# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon


## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great way to solidify my knowledge on requesting APIs with Vanilla JS, as I challenged myself to not use jQuery this time around. It was also useful to review throw/catch error treatment.

I was able to focus on delivering a responsive web design, consequently studying and implementing more responsive unities

### Continued development

As for future projects, I want to implement other ways of requesting APIs on Vanilla JS without having to use XMLHttpRequest. Responsive CSS is definitely an essential part of front-end web development, so studying it more is a must.
I forgot to make frequent commits while coding this Frontend Mentor challenge, which I ticked as a point of attention for future projects.
